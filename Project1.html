    <h1>Web Site Critique</h1>
    <h2>Website Reviewed: Trader Joe's - <a href="https://www.traderjoes.com">www.traderjoes.com</a></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>My first impression of the site was that it's a little underwhelming, considering how successful and well know Trader Joe's is. Then again, it's nice and simple, and not gunked up with too much unneccessary UI.</li>
        <li>The site information is organized with a top menu and sections stacked down the page. You mostly scroll and click into categories.</li>
        <li>The structure makes sense and is easy to follow. I don’t feel lost when I click around.</li>
        <li>The graphics enhance the site because they make the food look appealing. The layout feels fun and on-brand.</li>
        <li>The home page loads fairly quickly. The load time feels reasonable for a modern website.</li>
        <li>The text is easy to read and the colors don’t hurt my eyes. The background helps the site feel warm, not distracting.</li>
        <li>Yes, there is a clear navigation bar at the top. It’s easy to find what I’m looking for.</li>
        <li>The same style and colors are used across the pages. It feels consistent.</li>
        <li>On smaller screens, the layout adjusts and still works well. Nothing important gets cut off.</li>
        <li>The site does a great job making grocery shopping feel fun and interesting, not boring.</li>
